# princess-registry
Site where you can enter your name to be officially registered as a princess built for my daughter

Layout ideas:
-Should have an official house name (Roche?)
-Should have a text input field to record the name
-Should have a button to register
-After click should have some sort of animation to signify "knighting process"
-Should produce a royal lineage document (link to???)....Family tree with other nobles????
